Loud Patterns

Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. You are not your fucking work. Form follows fucking function. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. This design is fucking brilliant. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Respect your fucking craft.
